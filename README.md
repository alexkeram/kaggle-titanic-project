# Titanic - Predicting Survival Using Machine Learning

## Objective

Build a classification model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using demographic and travel information.  
This project is part of the Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster".


## Dataset Overview

- `train.csv`: 891 passengers — includes target variable `Survived`
- `test.csv`: 418 passengers — target variable missing

Main features:
